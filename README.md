# TAMU Tidal Hackathon Database

Welcome to the TAMU Tidal Hackathon Database repository! 🚀

This repository manages a database created and utilized by our team during the TAMU Tidal Hackathon, held on 11-11-2023. The database is powered by the Python library `sqlite3`, which facilitates the execution of commands essential for the competition.

## Usage

If you're interested in replicating this database or using the associated commands, consider changing the file name "main_database.db" to a name of your choice.

```python
# Example command to change the database file name
new_database_name = "your_custom_name.db"
```
