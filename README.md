# TAMU Tidal Hackathon Database

Welcome to the TAMU Tidal Hackathon Database repository! 🚀

This repository manages a database created and utilized by our team during the TAMU Tidal Hackathon, held on 11-11-2023. The database is powered by the Python library `sqlite3`, which facilitates the execution of commands essential for the competition.

## Usage

If you're interested in replicating this database or using the associated commands, consider changing the file name "main_database.db" to a name of your choice.

```python
# Example command to change the database file name
conn = sqlite3.connect('main_database.db') --> conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')
```

## Achievements

We're proud to share that this code, which contributed to our team receiving the 4th position out of 64 teams at the competition! 🏆😄

Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt this code for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
