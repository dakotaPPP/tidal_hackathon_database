Hello this repository creates and manages a database that was used by our team during the TAMU Tidal Hackathon that took place 11-11-2023.
The database uses the python library sqlite3 in order to run the commands needed for the competition.
If for some reason you'd like to copy this database and or the commands associated with it, then you may want to change each instance of "main_database.db" without whatever file name you'd like.

This code helped our team get 4th out of 64 teams present at the competition :D
